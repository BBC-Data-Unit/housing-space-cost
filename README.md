In December 2017 **Dan Wainwright** [reported on the cost of floor space in rental properties across the UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42154476), based on analysis of [data provided by a rental website](https://blog.openrent.co.uk/average-floor-area-of-rented-properties-per-100-rent/). Findings included:

* Each £100 of rent for a two-bed home in central London gets about 3.91 sq m, smaller than the average three-person tent
* Bradford is the city where £100 rents the biggest floor area in a two-bed home - 14.83 sq m
* Outside London, Oxford (5.03 sq m per £100 a month) and Bristol (6.98 sq m per £100 a month) were the most expensive places in the sample
* The average two-bed home in rural Lincolnshire is £200 a month, compared with £1,691 a month in London
